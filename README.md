# Python-DS-Course-Implementations
This repository contains my coursework for the Python for Data Science course. It includes a Jupyter Notebook where I implemented various machine learning algorithms from scratch and with scikit-learn, along with supporting resources and practice material.

# NOTE:
To use jupyter notebook, it is necessary to import [decision_tree pyhton file, all the csv files in this repo, and cat.jpg] in the jupyter notebook .
